Delhi's Air Quality Deteriorates Amid Rising Heat and Humidity
Delhi, July 6, 2018 – Over the past few days, Delhi experienced significant fluctuations in air quality, with several areas reporting poor to very poor conditions, coupled with intense heat and humidity.

On the evening of July 3, PM2.5 levels were estimated around 31 µg/m³, while PM10 was reported at 166 µg/m³. By late night, pollution increased with PM2.5 nearing 53 µg/m³ and PM10 hitting 229.5 µg/m³. Humidity was also on the rise, reaching around 71%, though exact temperatures at the time weren’t available.

Early July 4 showed high PM2.5 values, staying above 50 µg/m³ around 3 AM. PM10 remained elevated, though data from 4 to 6 AM was unavailable. Humidity crossed 82% during this time, worsening discomfort levels.

There was a brief improvement mid-morning, with PM10 dropping to 44.5 µg/m³. PM2.5 was recorded at 20.5 µg/m³, but temperature and humidity data were missing for that hour.

By 1 PM, partial data showed PM10 reaching 138.5 µg/m³, but no humidity information was recorded. Around 3 PM, PM10 rose again to 173 µg/m³, while humidity was estimated at 37.8%. The temperature was reportedly high, though exact figures were not confirmed.

On July 5, pollution continued to rise, but several readings were missed due to faulty monitoring equipment. At 5 PM, PM2.5 was recorded at 26 µg/m³, but PM10 readings weren’t captured. Night-time data was patchy, with one station reporting PM10 at 265 µg/m³.

The situation worsened in the early hours of July 6. Around 2 AM, PM2.5 crossed 101 µg/m³. PM10 values were missing from most stations except one, which recorded 264.5 µg/m³. Humidity was above 82%, but temperature data was incomplete.

By July 7, levels peaked. At 3 AM, PM2.5 hit 125.5 µg/m³ and PM10 touched 437 µg/m³. Humidity stayed around 75.77%, but no temperature reading was provided. Data from 5 AM to 7 AM is largely missing due to technical issues, but experts confirmed the air remained in the “very poor” category.

Environmental officials noted that stagnant weather and low wind speeds are causing pollutant buildup. A senior official commented, “We’re seeing a pollution pocket form over the city, and without rain or strong winds, it’s not dispersing.”

Citizens are advised to avoid outdoor exercise, keep air purifiers on indoors, and consult doctors if they experience respiratory symptoms.
