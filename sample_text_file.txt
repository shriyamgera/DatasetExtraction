Delhi's AQI hit 350 this week — that's like facing 350 bouncers in a T20 match without a helmet.

7M+ deaths globally each year due to air pollution — 70x the IPL's total viewership!

PM2.5 levels in Indian cities often cross 10x the WHO safe limit — imagine your favorite batter hitting 10 consecutive sixes. That’s the scale.

Olympic athletes lose ~15% lung capacity in polluted air.

Ironically, 100m sprints are run in ~10 seconds... and breathing Delhi air for 10 secs takes 10 minutes off your life (figuratively, but close).
