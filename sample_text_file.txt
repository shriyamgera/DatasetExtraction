India’s Pollution Crisis Deepens: New Report Reveals Alarming Stats on Air, Water, and Waste Levels
New Delhi, May 5, 2025 — A comprehensive report released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) today paints a grim picture of India’s environmental health, highlighting unprecedented levels of pollution across air, water, and solid waste domains.

Air Pollution: 70% of Cities Above Safe Levels
According to the report, over 244 of India’s 350 monitored cities recorded PM2.5 levels exceeding the safe limit of 40 µg/m³ set by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Notably:

Delhi recorded an average PM2.5 level of 126 µg/m³ in April 2025, over 3 times the safe limit.

Lucknow, Patna, and Kanpur followed closely with levels at 98, 91, and 87 µg/m³, respectively.

Only 28 cities saw an improvement of more than 10% compared to April 2024.

The data further shows that vehicular emissions (39%), construction dust (21%), and industrial discharge (18%) remain the top contributors to urban air pollution.

Water Pollution: 46% of Rivers Unsafe for Bathing
India’s rivers are no less distressed. Of the 311 monitored river stretches, 143 (46%) were found unfit for bathing or agricultural use due to high levels of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Fecal Coliform bacteria.

Key findings include:

The Yamuna River in Delhi showed a BOD level of 65 mg/L, nearly 13 times higher than the acceptable limit of 5 mg/L.

65% of rural households in Uttar Pradesh rely on groundwater sources that show nitrate concentrations above the permissible limit of 45 mg/L, indicating contamination from fertilizers and sewage.
